## Git configuration

1.  Replace the placeholder **Your Name** with your GitHub username

2.  Replace **Your Email** with your email address

3.  Keep the quotes!

4.  Save the file by clicking on the **Save** icon in the Source pane or by pressing `Ctrl + S` (Windows/Linux) or `Cmd + S` (Mac).

5.  Render the document by clicking the **Render** button in the Source pane.

These will be the details that git will use to identify you when you make changes to your work.

```{r}
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "Mutyalu Sheshu", user.email = "mutyalusheshu@gmail.com")
```
